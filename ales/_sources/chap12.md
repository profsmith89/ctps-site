# Chapter 12

## ALE 12.1: A shell game

In the chapter, we learned that the sort most of us use to order the playing cards when dealt a hand is called *insertion sort*. Despite the fact that it isn't that efficient---it has a worst-case performance of $O(n^2)$---it was easy to understand and code.

In this exercise, we'll look at a related sort called *Shellsort*, which is named after Donald Shell who published the first description of the method in 1959. I grabbed the pseudocode for this sort from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort) and implemented a version of it in Python. How it works is much more cryptic.

**Step 1.** Re-familiarize yourself with insertion sort by reading through the following code. This version counts the number of swaps that the algorithm takes to sort the input list. If you want to see these swaps as they take place, uncomment the print-statements on lines 10 and 15. **Make sure to replace the comment characters before you proceed to the next step.**

### chap12/ale01/insertion.py

def insertion_sort(s):
    '''Sorts the unsorted sequence s in place and
       returns the number of swaps performed.
    '''
    swaps = 0

    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        #print(f'Considering item at index {i}')
        for j in range(i, 0, -1):
            if s[j - 1] > s[j]:
                # Swap the two items
                s[j - 1], s[j] = s[j], s[j - 1]
                #print(f'Swapped {j-1},{j}: {s}')
                swaps += 1
            else:
                # When swaps are done, the ith element is where it belongs
                break
                
    return swaps
```

You can test `insertion_sort` using this code block:

```{code-block} python
---
lineno-start: 25
---
### chap12/ale01/insertion.py

# A simple test routine
s_test = [62, 83, 18, 53, 7, 17, 95, 86, 47, 69, 25, 28]
print(f'unsorted list: {s_test}\n')
    
swaps = insertion_sort(s_test)
print(f'sorted list: {s_test}\n')
print(f'total swaps (INSERTION sort) = {swaps}')
```

**Step 2.** Now let's look at the code for Shellsort and try to understand its behavior (i.e., don't yet run it). To be clear, I don't expect you to go through every line of code. Instead, we'll practice our skills at understanding the computational complexity of an algorithm.

Let's start with a simple question. In the function `shell_sort`, **how many loops do you see?** You can ignore the function `gen_gaps`, i.e., assume the call to that function takes a fixed amount of time.

```{code-block} python
---
lineno-start: 1
---
### chap12/ale01/shell.py
'''
Shellsort, translated to Python using pseudocode from: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort
'''

def gen_gaps(n):
    '''Compute and return a shellsort gap sequence'''
    gaps = []
    k = 1
    g = n // (2**k)
    while g != 0:
        gaps.append(g)
        k += 1
        g = n // (2**k)
    return gaps
    

def shell_sort(s):
    '''Sorts the unsorted sequence s in place and
       returns the number of swaps performed.

       Comments below this line are unchanged from
       the wikipedia entry.
    '''
    swaps = 0

    gaps = gen_gaps(len(s))
    #print(f'gap sequence: {gaps}\n')
    
    # Start with the largest gap and work down to a gap of 1
    # similar to insertion sort but instead of 1, gap is being used in each step
    for gap in gaps:
        # Do a gapped insertion sort for every elements in gaps
        # Each loop leaves a[0..gap-1] in gapped order
        for i in range(gap, len(s), 1):
    
            # save s[i] in temp and make a hole at position i
            temp = s[i]
    
            # shift earlier gap-sorted elements up until the correct location
            # for s[i] is found
            j = i
            while j >= gap and s[j - gap] > temp:
                s[j] = s[j - gap]
                j -= gap
                swaps += 1
    
            # put temp (the original a[i]) in its correct location
            s[j] = temp

    return swaps
```

You should see three: a for-loop on line 34; another on line 37; and a while-loop on line 45.

We know that nested loops mean multiplication: we multiply together the expected iteration count of each loop. But the innermost of the three loops in `shell_sort` is a while-loop with a complex looping condition, it's not easy to tell how many iterations it will take.

If you're tempted to figure out the computational complexity of `shell_sort`, **don't**. It is an open question in computer science. Instead, we'll just check our intuition.

_Do you expect a sort with **three** nested loops to take more or less time than one with **two** nested loops?_

When you've decided on an answer to this question, move on.

**Step 3.** As a proxy for execution time, we'll count the number of swaps each sorting algorithm performs. Notice that `shell_sort` counts the number of swaps that it does on line 48, and like our implementation of `insertion_sort`, it returns this count (in addition to sorting the input array in place).

Suspense is over! Have `shell_sort` order the same test list we used for `insertion_sort`.

```{code-block} python
---
lineno-start: 57
---
### chap12/ale01/shell.py

# A simple test routine
s_test = [62, 83, 18, 53, 7, 17, 95, 86, 47, 69, 25, 28]
print(f'unsorted list: {s_test}\n')
    
swaps = shell_sort(s_test)
print(f'sorted list: {s_test}\n')
print(f'total swaps (SHELL sort) = {swaps}')
```

Are you surprised?

**Step 4.** Maybe you think I pulled a fast one on you. Let's compare these two sorting algorithms by generating a number of large arrays of random numbers.

In the following code block, the function `rnd_list` generates a list of length `n` of random numbers between `0` and `max_elem` inclusive. The function `aprint` avoids printing all the elements in a very long list, where "very long" is defined as more than 10 elements.

```{code-block} python
---
lineno-start: 7
---
### chap12/ale01/cmp.py
import random

def rnd_list(n, max_elem):
    '''Generate a random, unsorted list 'a' of n numbers 
       between 0 and max_elem
    '''
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(random.choice(range(max_elem + 1)))
    return a

def aprint(header, a):
    '''Avoids printing huge arrays'''
    n = len(a)

    print(header, end='')
    if n > 10:
        print(f'[{a[0]}, {a[1]}, {a[2]}, {a[3]}, ... \
              {a[n-4]}, {a[n-3]}, {a[n-2]}, {a[n-1]}]')
    else:
        print(a)
```

We'll now use these helper functions to run three competitions between `insertion_sort` and `shell_sort`. Run the next code block several times.

```{code-block} python
---
lineno-start: 7
---
### chap12/ale01/cmp.py
for n in (10, 100, 1000):
    a = rnd_list(n, 999)
    b = a.copy()

    print(f'\n***{n} elements in array***')
    aprint('  unsorted list: ', a)
    print()

    swaps = insertion_sort(a)
    aprint('  sorted list: ', a)
    print(f'  total swaps (INSERTION sort) = {swaps}')

    print()

    swaps = shell_sort(b)
    aprint('  sorted list: ', a)
    print(f'  total swaps (SHELL sort) = {swaps}')
```

Wild, huh?

**Step 5.** Here's a brief explanation of why `shell_sort` wins, as described at the start of the Wikipedia article referenced above: *"The method starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared. By starting with far apart elements, it can move some out-of-place elements into position faster than a simple nearest neighbor exchange."*

That's a wonderful example of "here's an idea for how we might do things more efficiently." Of course, an idea needs to be fleshed out. Donald Shell did that. And with some code, he showed that it worked more efficiently *in practice*. He also left us with a puzzle, and you can read the Wikipedia page for more on that.

## ALE 12.2: Taco cat

In this active learning exercise, our problem to solve is identifying palindromes! And you're going to do it using a divide-and-conquer approach and then code that approach using recursion.

A palindrome is a word or phrase that is unchanged whether you read it from left to right or right to left. The word 'kayak' is an example of a palindrome. Ignoring spaces, the title of this ALE is another palindrome, which might be a weirdly named pet.

Your task is to write a function called `is_palindrome` that takes a single formal parameter `s`, which it expects to be a string, and returns `True` if the input string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

**Step 1.** Recursion expects that the parameter to the recursive call inside the recursive function is somehow a smaller version of the problem. What might we do to a palindrome to create a smaller version of the problem?

Well, consider the example word I gave above: kayak. This word is a palindrome if:

1. the first and last letters satisfy what we expect in a palindrome; and
2. the remaining middle three letters are also a palindrome.

To answer the second statement, we'd call is\_palindrome on 'aya'. If `s` is the name given to the string `'kayak'`, write a check for the first statement and the recursive call for the second.

**Step 2.** Now that we know the form of the recursion, let's identify the base cases. In this problem, there are two. Why? Well, we're stripping off two letters at a time and strings can contain either an even or odd number of letters.

Continuing with `s` as the name of the input string, write down when you know a string is a palindrome by checking nothing more than its length.

**Step 3.** Let's start putting our recursive function together. I've helped you get started with the function definition and a statement that strips anything other than the letters `a-z` and the digits `0-9`. Yes, your routine will check numbers and phrases with numbers to see if they're palindromes.

```{code-block} python
---
lineno-start: 1
---
### chap12/ale02.py

def is_palindrome(s):
    '''Returns True if s is a palindrome'''

    # Strip prefix/suffix punctuation and spacing
    s = s.strip(' \t\n\'"~!@#$%^&*()-_+={}[]\\|;:<>,.?/')

    # REPLACE THIS COMMENT AND THE NEXT RETURN WITH YOUR CODE
    return False
```

Let's run a few simple tests.

```{code-block} python
---
lineno-start: 42
---
### chap12/ale02.py

def check(s):
    print(f'"{s}" is', end=' ')
    if not is_palindrome(s):
        print('not', end=' ')
    print('a palindrome\n')


check('mom')
check('Mom')
check('121')
check('23cs32')
check('not')
check('notion')
```

**Step 4.** Is it really right to say that `'M'` doesn't match `'m'`? Have your version of `is_palindrome` ignore capitalization and then rerun the tests above.

**Step 5.** Here are a few tougher tests. Try adding some of your own.

```{code-block} python

## ALE 12.3: Fib frequently and forever

If you enjoy building or graphic design, you've probably heard about [the Golden ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio), which is said to make such designs pleasing to the human eye. Definitionally, values `a` and `b` satisfy the Golden ratio if `a/b == (a+b)/a`, where `a > b > 0`. This ratio is an irrational number, which means that there are no integers `a` and `b` that produce it. However, there are sequences produced by simple algorithms that approach its value (1.618033988749...), and one of these sequences is called the *Fibonacci numbers*.

This is the beginning of the Fibonacci sequence:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

You obtain the next number in the sequence by computing the sum of the previous two numbers. For example, `144` follows `89` because it is the `55+89`.

This sequence is related to the Golden ratio because each pair of consecutive Fibonacci numbers (call the smaller of the pair `a` and the larger `b`) approximates this ratio. As the Fibonacci numbers increase in magnitude, these approximations approach the Golden ratio (e.g., 89/55 is a better approximation than 55/34).

**Step 1.** If we think of the Fibonacci numbers as a Python sequence, we can design a recursive function `fib` that produces any number in this sequence. Our routine takes a single parameter `n`, which is a zero-based index into the Fibonacci numbers, and then computes the value of the number at that index. For instance, `fib(4)` should return `3`, and the result of `fib(12)` should be `144`.

* The recursive part of `fib` comes directly from the statement earlier that described how we compute the next number in the Fibonacci sequence: sum the previous two numbers. This means that if we knew `fib(n-1)` and `fib(n-2)`, we could quickly compute and return `fib(n)`.
* The base cases of `fib` are the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, since the recursive step looked back at the previous two numbers.

With this description, write the body of the function fib in the next code block and test it with the statements in the subsequent block.

```{code-block} python

### chap12/ale03.py

def fib(n):
    '''Return the Fibonacci number at 0-based index n'''
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError('Fibonacci is defined only for positive n')
    
    # INSERT BASE CASES AND THE RECURSIVE CALL
    return 0  # and REMOVE THIS
```

```{code-block} python
---
lineno-start: 10
---
### chap12/ale03.py

# Test code
print('Testing fib ...')
assert fib(0) == 0, 'Failed for n = 0'
assert fib(1) == 1, 'Failed for n = 1'
assert fib(2) == 1, 'Failed for n = 2'
assert fib(3) == 2, 'Failed for n = 3'
assert fib(4) == 3, 'Failed for n = 4'
assert fib(5) == 5, 'Failed for n = 5'
assert fib(6) == 8, 'Failed for n = 6'
assert fib(8) == 21, 'Failed for n = 8'
assert fib(12) == 144, 'Failed for n = 12'
print('PASSED our unit tests!')
```

**Step 2.** It is easy to write the body of the recursive function `fib` from the recurrence relation that defines the Fibonacci sequence: `fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`. The function `ifib` defined in the next code block is an iterative implementation. Run its tests to verify that it works correctly.

```{code-block} python
---
lineno-start: 1
---
### chap12/ale03.py

def ifib(n):
    '''Return the Fibonacci number at 0-based index n'''
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError('Fibonacci is defined only for positive n')
    elif n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1

    ra = 0    # fib(0) 
    rb = 1    # fib(1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # Use last two fib numbers to compute fib(i)
        ra, rb = rb, ra + rb

    return rb
```

```{code-block} python
---
lineno-start: 10
---
### chap12/ale03.py

# Test code
print('Testing ifib ...')
assert ifib(0) == 0, 'Failed for n = 0'
assert ifib(1) == 1, 'Failed for n = 1'
assert ifib(2) == 1, 'Failed for n = 2'
assert ifib(3) == 2, 'Failed for n = 3'
assert ifib(4) == 3, 'Failed for n = 4'
assert ifib(5) == 5, 'Failed for n = 5'
assert ifib(6) == 8, 'Failed for n = 6'
assert ifib(8) == 21, 'Failed for n = 8'
assert ifib(12) == 144, 'Failed for n = 12'
print('PASSED our unit tests!')
```

**Step 3.** While the recursive implementation is easy to read and understand compared to the iterative implementation, this easy-of-coding quality comes at a price. In the case of `fib`, it is a big price. Run the next code block and notice, for a large `n`, how quickly `ifib` completes its work compared to `fib`. Feel free to experiment with different values of `n`.

```{code-block} python
---
lineno-start: 10
---
### chap12/ale03.py

    # Run with a bigger n
    n = 38
    print(f'Running ifib({n}) = ')
    print(ifib(n))
    print(f'Running fib({n}) = ')
    print(fib(n))    
```

What's the issue that causes this large increase in the running time of such a simple, short function? While it does take longer to execute a function call (i.e., evaluate `fib(n-2)` in `fib`) than to look up a value (i.e., `ra` in `ifib`), this isn't the real problem. The real culprit is duplicated work.

In computing `ifib(38)`, the interpreter computes, say, the Fibonacci number at index 5 just once, when `i` in the for-loop is set to `5`. How many times does the interpreter compute this same number when we call `fib(38)`? Not once, but many times.

How many times? It's a cool answer. With `n = 38`, we recursively call `fib(36)` and `fib(37)`. Each of those calls also make recursive calls: `fib(36)` invokes `fib(34)` and `fib(35)`; `fib(37)` invokes `fib(35)` and `fib(36)`. Draw these calls as a tree rooted at `fib(38)`, and you'll notice (when you draw more of the tree) that there's one `fib(38)` call, one `fib(37)` call, two `fib(36)` calls, three `fib(35)` calls, five `fib(34)` calls, eight `fib(33)` calls, and so forth. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 calls. The Fibonacci sequence again!

So how many times is `fib(5)` called in computing `fib(38)`? If `n = 38` is index 1 and `n = 37` is index 2 in the Fibonacci sequence, what is `n = 5`? Right, `38 - 5 + 1`, or index 34. The Fibonacci number at that index is 5,720,887. That's a lot of times to calculate `fib(5) = 5`. We compute similar duplicative work for every number between `0` and `n-2`.

Our computers are fast, but it is possible to overwhelm them with some very simple scripts.
